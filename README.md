# Portfolio
Code Samples for Job Applications.


Code taken from programs written for Data Structures, Algorithms and Machine Learning classes.

Data Structures: DSString, DSVector, AVL tree, hashtable

Algorithms: Best Fit, Girvan-Newman, Disjoint Set, Kruskal's Algorithm, Travelling Salesman

Machine Learning: MultiLayerPerceptron (if the file does not load, just try reloading it for some reason github does not like jupytr notebook files)
