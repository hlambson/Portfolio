# Portfolio
Code Samples for Job Applications.


Code taken from programs written for Data Structures, Algorithms and Machine Learning classes. All code from Data Structures and Algorithms is in C++. Machine Learning code is in Jupyter Notebook using python.

Data Structures: DSString, DSVector, AVL tree, hashtable

Algorithms: Best Fit, Girvan-Newman, Disjoint Set, Kruskal's Algorithm, Travelling Salesman

Machine Learning: MultiLayerPerceptron, Wide and Deep Network (if the file does not load, just try reloading it for some reason github does not like jupyter notebook files)
