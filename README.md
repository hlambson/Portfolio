# Portfolio
Code Samples for Job Applications.


Code taken from programs written for Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence classes. All code from Data Structures and Algorithms is in C++. Machine Learning and AI code is in Jupyter Notebook using python. The src folder is from Advanced Application Programming, explanation on what it is below.

Data Structures (CS 2341): DSString, DSVector, AVL tree, hashtable

Algorithms (CS 3353): Best Fit, Girvan-Newman, Disjoint Set, Kruskal's Algorithm, Travelling Salesman

Machine Learning in Python (CS 5321): MultiLayerPerceptron, Wide and Deep Network

Machine Learning and Nueral Networks (CS 8321)  Multi Task Neural Networks, Calculating MELD via Neural Nets 

Artificial Intelligence (CS 5320): n-queens, maze

Advanced Application Programming (CS 7345): This code is from a project which takes rust code and transpiles it into WebAssembly as a module to be used in JavaScript. This allows you to run optimized and fast code in browser, rather than using JavaScript. This folder contains the source files for that project. The code to transpile all of the classes is in lib.rs, and a rust server to run the code locally is in main.rs.
